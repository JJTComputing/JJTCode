<h2>Welcome to JJTCode</h2>
<p>Welcome to JJTCode, a code repository for both open source and proprietary software from 
<a href="http://jjtcomputing.co.uk/">JJTComputing.</a>
At the moment, JJTCode is under development, and if you find a bug please <a href="http://www.jjtcomputing.co.uk/contact">Contact Us.</a></p>
<p>JJTCode is not a 'traditional' code repository, think of it more as 
<a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> for code rather than 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> or <a href="http://tigris.org">Tigris.org.</a></p>
