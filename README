JJTCode is the software behind the website code.jjtcomputing.co.uk. I'm not
quite sure what you might want it for, unless you just want to have a look at
the code, because it is written purely for code.jjtcomputing.co.uk rather than
for the general public. 

At the moment, this code is highly broken because I'm rebuilding it using
objects so unless you are really comfortable with messing around with code
that does weird and wonderful things, do not use this.

If you do use it on your own website, it would be great if you sent me an
email at: tristan@jjtcomputing.co.uk because I like to know where my code gets
to.
